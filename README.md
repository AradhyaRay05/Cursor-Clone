# Cursor Landing Page Recreation

> This project is a desktop-first developer tool landing page inspired by the Cursor website. The goal was to achieve **visual and structural accuracy** to the original, focusing on layout, typography, color palette, and overall hierarchy. No creativity, interactivity, or responsiveness was required.
